# Intrusion_Redo

This project represent the reproduction of my MSc Thesis code orignally developed in Matlab

Currently the Main files include:
1. get_ftp_BBMP.sh -- Which download data from the BBMP server
2. data_ETL.py -- Extracts, Tranforms and Load data into usable data file .plk
3. main_functions.py -- Allowsyou to manually identify intrusion events and estimate the optimal coefficients to identify the intrusions you identified. Other functions are avaible in this file. Including Plotting the pofiles by year, importing data, and more.

NOTE: While it is functional is several aspects, there are a lot of untested functionalities and might be a bit hard to operate for now.
